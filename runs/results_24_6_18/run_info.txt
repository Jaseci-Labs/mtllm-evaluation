Experimentation
- Capturing Performance of MTLLM with Semstring

Jac implementations
- Everything thats going to involve with MTLLM is Semstringed heavily to make sure that the model is understanding the 
context

Conclusion
- By comparing the non semstring evaluation results against semstring evaluation results, we can see there is no big difference
when it comes to the typed outputs. Both provide correct typed output with required information.
- But in non semstring implementations, developer has to makesure the variable names and function names are properly named
and gives some kind of insight we are tring to achieve.
for examples-
In problem essay_reviewer, we have to provide that we are expecting a str which is A-D by naming the function `give_grade_A_to_D`
instead of `give_grade` in semstring version.
In this the best solution could be one of the Following
1. Adding Semstring to the Return Type hints
```jac
can give_grade(summary: str) -> 'A-D': str by llm();
```
2. Using a ENUM as the output instead of str
```jac
enum Grade {
    A, B, C, D
}
can give_grade_A_to_D(summary: str) -> Grade by llm();
```
- Implementation with Semstring is more robust when it comes using already created classes where you dont want to 
change the variable names, need to provide more context or need more inputs or rules.
- Semstring approach uses more tokens (prompt tokens)
- It is advised to start with the non-semstring approach in the begining and add semstring according to your need.
