 [Output] "Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence system designed to understand and generate human language. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and use deep learning techniques to predict and produce coherent and contextually relevant text. Examples include OpenAI's GPT-3 and Google's BERT, which have various applications such as language translation, content creation, and conversational agents."
