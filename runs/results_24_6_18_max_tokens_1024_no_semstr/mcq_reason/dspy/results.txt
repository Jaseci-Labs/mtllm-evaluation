Output:
 Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to determine the date 10 days ago from a week before September 1st, 2021. 

1. First, we need to establish the date a week before September 1st, 2021. 
   - September 1st, 2021 is 09/01/2021.
   - A week before September 1st, 2021 is 7 days earlier.
   - Subtracting 7 days from September 1st, 2021, we get August 25th, 2021 (09/01/2021 - 7 days = 08/25/2021).

2. Next, we need to find the date 10 days before August 25th, 2021.
   - Subtracting 10 days from August 25th, 2021, we get August 15th, 2021 (08/25/2021 - 10 days = 08/15/2021).

3. Now, we need to match this date with the given choices.

Answer: None of the given choices (A-F) match the calculated date of 08/15/2021. Therefore, there is no correct answer among the provided options.
