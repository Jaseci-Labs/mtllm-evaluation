 Question: What are Large Language Models?
Expert: Artificial Intelligence Researcher
Answer: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human language. These models are typically based on deep learning architectures, such as transformers, and are trained on vast amounts of text data. The training process involves learning the statistical properties of language, which allows the model to predict and generate coherent and contextually relevant text. Examples of large language models include OpenAI's GPT-3 and Google's BERT. These models have a wide range of applications, including natural language processing tasks like translation, summarization, question answering, and conversational agents.
