 [Output] Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems trained on vast amounts of text data from diverse sources. They can understand, generate, and manipulate human language with a high degree of fluency and accuracy. Examples include OpenAI's GPT-3 and Google's BERT. These models are used in various applications such as chatbots, translation services, and content creation.
