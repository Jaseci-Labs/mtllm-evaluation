While the essay provides a brief overview of the topic and presents the writer's perspective, it could benefit from clearer and more concise language to improve its clarity. Additionally, the essay could use more specific and unique examples to make it stand out. However, the essay provides sufficient evidence to support its claims about the struggles faced by Spaniards in preserving their cultural identity and language rights.\nGrade:  B-"
