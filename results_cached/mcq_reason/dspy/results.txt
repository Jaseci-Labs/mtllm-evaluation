Output:
 Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer. We need to evaluate the expression \(2 \times 1012 + \frac{1}{2}\).

1. First, calculate \(2 \times 1012\):
   \[
   2 \times 1012 = 2024
   \]

2. Next, add \(\frac{1}{2}\) to the result:
   \[
   2024 + \frac{1}{2} = 2024.5
   \]

Answer: (B) 2024.5
