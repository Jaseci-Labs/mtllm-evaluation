Answer: Large Language Models are advanced AI systems that utilize machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform a variety of tasks such as translation, summarization, question-answering, and more. They have the ability to capture complex patterns in language due to their extensive training datasets and sophisticated neural network architectures.
