Computer Scientist - Specialized in AI says: '<Large Language Models are advanced AI systems that utilize machine learning algorithms to process, understand, and generate human language. They are trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform a variety of natural language processing tasks such as translation, summarization, question answering, and conversation with users. These models have significantly impacted the field of artificial intelligence by enabling more sophisticated interaction between humans and machines.>
