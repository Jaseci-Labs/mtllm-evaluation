[Chain of Thoughts] To find the date 10 days before Sept. 1st, 2021, we subtract 10 days from that date. September has 30 days, so if we go back 10 days from September 1st, it would be August 22nd. However, since the choices provided are in MM/DD/YYYY format and considering a week's timeframe mentioned (which doesn't affect the calculation), we need to find the closest date among the options given that is exactly 10 days before Sept. 1st, 2021.

[Output] A
