Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate Weng's earnings. First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 minutes is equal to 0.83 hours (50/60). Now, we can multiply the amount of time Weng worked by her hourly wage to get her total earnings.

Question: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?

Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to determine how many pages Julie has left to read after today and then calculate half of that amount for tomorrow's reading goal. First, we need to figure out how many pages Julie read today, which is twice the number of pages she read yesterday (12 pages). So, 2 * 12 = 24 pages were read today. In total, she has read 12 + 24 = 36 pages so far. To find out how many pages are left in the book after today's reading, we subtract the total pages read from the total number of pages in the book: 120 - 36 = 84 pages left. Since Julie wants to read half of these remaining pages tomorrow, we divide the remaining pages by 2: 84 / 2 = 42.\nAnswer: 42""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama3.1:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T01:32:08.536935374Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 22818, 279, 5151, 1595, 7998, 7964, 8356, 279, 5151, 1595, 9399, 63438, 45464, 12763, 279, 2768, 3645, 382, 14924, 25, 3654, 7998, 534, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 3654, 98374, 279, 4320, 7966, 1226, 12515, 16533, 25, 3654, 9399, 92, 320, 66454, 449, 264, 3254, 528, 907, 696, 45464, 14924, 25, 42287, 374, 5403, 264, 220, 4364, 15463, 2363, 13, 61133, 11, 1364, 574, 3025, 311, 1373, 220, 717, 6959, 323, 3432, 11, 1364, 1373, 11157, 439, 1690, 6959, 439, 13985, 13, 1442, 1364, 6944, 311, 1373, 4376, 315, 279, 9861, 6959, 16986, 11, 1268, 1690, 6959, 1288, 1364, 1373, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 14924, 25, 42287, 374, 5403, 264, 220, 4364, 15463, 2363, 13, 61133, 11, 1364, 574, 3025, 311, 1373, 220, 717, 6959, 323, 3432, 11, 1364, 1373, 11157, 439, 1690, 6959, 439, 13985, 13, 1442, 1364, 6944, 311, 1373, 4376, 315, 279, 9861, 6959, 16986, 11, 1268, 1690, 6959, 1288, 1364, 1373, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 8417, 1268, 1690, 6959, 42287, 706, 2163, 311, 1373, 1306, 3432, 323, 1243, 11294, 4376, 315, 430, 3392, 369, 16986, 596, 5403, 5915, 13, 5629, 11, 584, 1205, 311, 7216, 704, 1268, 1690, 6959, 42287, 1373, 3432, 11, 902, 374, 11157, 279, 1396, 315, 6959, 1364, 1373, 13985, 320, 717, 6959, 570, 2100, 11, 220, 17, 353, 220, 717, 284, 220, 1187, 6959, 1051, 1373, 3432, 13, 763, 2860, 11, 1364, 706, 1373, 220, 717, 489, 220, 1187, 284, 220, 1927, 6959, 779, 3117, 13, 2057, 1505, 704, 1268, 1690, 6959, 527, 2163, 304, 279, 2363, 1306, 3432, 596, 5403, 11, 584, 33356, 279, 2860, 6959, 1373, 505, 279, 2860, 1396, 315, 6959, 304, 279, 2363, 25, 220, 4364, 482, 220, 1927, 284, 220, 5833, 6959, 2163, 13, 8876, 42287, 6944, 311, 1373, 4376, 315, 1521, 9861, 6959, 16986, 11, 584, 22497, 279, 9861, 6959, 555, 220, 17, 25, 220, 5833, 611, 220, 17, 284, 220, 2983, 627, 16533, 25, 220, 2983], ""total_duration"": 143573572036, ""load_duration"": 20453258041, ""prompt_eval_count"": 130, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1673923000, ""eval_count"": 227, ""eval_duration"": 121443212000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 130, ""completion_tokens"": 227, ""total_tokens"": 357}}]",

Finally, he adds gummy worms to double the weight again, so now it's 2 x 8 = 16 pounds.\n\nAnswer: 16""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama3:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T02:07:15.741817749Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 22818, 279, 5151, 1595, 7998, 7964, 8356, 279, 5151, 1595, 9399, 63438, 45464, 12763, 279, 2768, 3645, 382, 14924, 25, 3654, 7998, 534, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 3654, 98374, 279, 4320, 7966, 1226, 12515, 16533, 25, 3654, 9399, 92, 320, 66454, 449, 264, 3254, 528, 907, 696, 45464, 14924, 25, 14594, 3549, 264, 2512, 6462, 311, 3708, 311, 813, 10868, 11, 889, 574, 3201, 520, 50069, 2978, 13, 220, 14594, 9277, 264, 3830, 389, 264, 5569, 11, 323, 1243, 568, 44033, 1139, 279, 3830, 3403, 52441, 27994, 311, 4546, 279, 4785, 311, 220, 17, 16701, 13, 220, 5112, 11, 568, 3779, 3403, 14198, 552, 311, 5353, 279, 4785, 311, 24657, 13, 220, 9479, 11, 568, 3779, 2500, 220, 17, 16701, 315, 52441, 27994, 13, 220, 1628, 5616, 11, 568, 3779, 3403, 342, 8742, 63000, 311, 2033, 279, 4785, 3131, 1578, 13, 220, 3639, 574, 279, 1620, 4785, 315, 279, 3830, 315, 70855, 11, 304, 16701, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 98374, 279, 4320, 382, 791, 2926, 4785, 374, 220, 15, 16701, 13, 5112, 14594, 11621, 52441, 27994, 3156, 433, 25501, 220, 17, 16701, 13, 9479, 11, 568, 11621, 14198, 552, 323, 89661, 279, 4785, 11, 779, 1457, 433, 596, 220, 18, 865, 220, 17, 284, 220, 21, 16701, 13, 4740, 430, 11, 568, 11621, 2500, 220, 17, 16701, 315, 52441, 27994, 11, 3339, 433, 220, 21, 489, 220, 17, 284, 220, 23, 16701, 13, 17830, 11, 568, 11621, 342, 8742, 63000, 311, 2033, 279, 4785, 1578, 11, 779, 1457, 433, 596, 220, 17, 865, 220, 23, 284, 220, 845, 16701, 382, 16533, 25, 220, 845], ""total_duration"": 73739968099, ""load_duration"": 19609507492, ""prompt_eval_count"": 186, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1703055000, ""eval_count"": 106, ""eval_duration"": 52378808000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 186, ""completion_tokens"": 106, ""total_tokens"": 292}}]",

She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes. We know that she spent a total of $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $145 on her other clothes. We also know that she has $16 left from her budget, so the total amount she spent on all her clothes is $145 + $16 = $161. Since she lost the receipt for the shoes, we can't know for sure how much she paid for them, but we can infer that she paid less than $161 - $145 = $16 for the shoes.

First, we need to find out how many hours of overtime she worked each day. Since she works 10 hours and overtime starts after 8 hours, she worked 2 hours of overtime per day. Her hourly wage for overtime is $18 + (1/2)$18 = $27. So, her daily earnings are 8 hours x $18 + 2 hours x $27 = $144 + $54 = $198. Since she works 5 days, her total earnings are 5 x $198 = $990.\nAnswer: 990""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama3:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T03:36:31.868852911Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 22818, 279, 5151, 1595, 7998, 7964, 8356, 279, 5151, 1595, 9399, 63438, 45464, 12763, 279, 2768, 3645, 382, 14924, 25, 3654, 7998, 534, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 3654, 98374, 279, 4320, 7966, 1226, 12515, 16533, 25, 3654, 9399, 92, 320, 66454, 449, 264, 3254, 528, 907, 696, 45464, 14924, 25, 64787, 3727, 400, 972, 13, 410, 459, 6596, 13, 220, 1442, 1364, 4375, 810, 1109, 220, 23, 4207, 824, 6541, 11, 1364, 374, 17446, 369, 39599, 11, 902, 374, 7318, 555, 701, 47729, 19602, 489, 220, 16, 14, 17, 701, 47729, 19602, 13, 220, 1442, 1364, 4375, 220, 605, 4207, 1475, 1938, 369, 220, 20, 2919, 11, 1268, 1790, 3300, 1587, 1364, 1304, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 14924, 25, 64787, 3727, 400, 972, 13, 410, 459, 6596, 13, 220, 1442, 1364, 4375, 810, 1109, 220, 23, 4207, 824, 6541, 11, 1364, 374, 17446, 369, 39599, 11, 902, 374, 7318, 555, 701, 47729, 19602, 489, 220, 16, 14, 17, 701, 47729, 19602, 13, 220, 1442, 1364, 4375, 220, 605, 4207, 1475, 1938, 369, 220, 20, 2919, 11, 1268, 1790, 3300, 1587, 1364, 1304, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 11294, 64787, 596, 2860, 24608, 13, 5629, 11, 584, 1205, 311, 1505, 704, 1268, 1690, 4207, 315, 39599, 1364, 6575, 1855, 1938, 13, 8876, 1364, 4375, 220, 605, 4207, 323, 39599, 8638, 1306, 220, 23, 4207, 11, 1364, 6575, 220, 17, 4207, 315, 39599, 824, 1938, 13, 6385, 47729, 19602, 369, 39599, 374, 400, 972, 489, 320, 16, 14, 17, 15437, 972, 284, 400, 1544, 13, 2100, 11, 1077, 7446, 24608, 527, 220, 23, 4207, 865, 400, 972, 489, 220, 17, 4207, 865, 400, 1544, 284, 400, 8929, 489, 400, 4370, 284, 400, 3753, 13, 8876, 1364, 4375, 220, 20, 2919, 11, 1077, 2860, 24608, 527, 220, 20, 865, 400, 3753, 284, 400, 19146, 627, 16533, 25, 220, 19146], ""total_duration"": 119854137513, ""load_duration"": 19637628278, ""prompt_eval_count"": 144, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1690543000, ""eval_count"": 198, ""eval_duration"": 98472014000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 144, ""completion_tokens"": 198, ""total_tokens"": 342}}]",

Therefore, the number of people on the ship consumed in the first hundred years is half the number of people consumed over the entire 300-year period.\nAnswer: 423 (Respond with a single int value)""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama2:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T03:42:54.061359058Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [518, 25580, 29962, 3532, 14816, 29903, 29958, 5299, 829, 14816, 29903, 6778, 13, 13, 29954, 5428, 278, 4235, 421, 12470, 1673, 7738, 278, 4235, 421, 12011, 1412, 13, 13, 5634, 13, 13, 29943, 2952, 278, 1494, 3402, 29889, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 6435, 12470, 29913, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 6435, 5498, 346, 278, 1234, 1836, 1334, 2023, 13, 22550, 29901, 6435, 12011, 29913, 313, 1666, 2818, 411, 263, 2323, 938, 995, 29897, 13, 13, 5634, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 319, 6483, 29899, 344, 29874, 1601, 2475, 364, 4637, 515, 278, 19922, 2748, 1432, 6893, 2440, 304, 1238, 579, 373, 263, 7751, 322, 269, 403, 967, 18757, 261, 29889, 6811, 2211, 6893, 2440, 29892, 372, 756, 11233, 287, 29871, 29947, 29946, 29955, 2305, 29889, 1383, 4512, 505, 1063, 4240, 7200, 975, 931, 29892, 577, 1269, 716, 7751, 756, 8951, 408, 1784, 2305, 408, 278, 1833, 7751, 29889, 1128, 1784, 2305, 892, 373, 278, 7751, 278, 1601, 2475, 263, 371, 297, 278, 937, 6893, 2440, 29973, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 518, 29914, 25580, 29962, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 319, 6483, 29899, 344, 29874, 1601, 2475, 364, 4637, 515, 278, 19922, 2748, 1432, 6893, 2440, 304, 1238, 579, 373, 263, 7751, 322, 269, 403, 967, 18757, 261, 29889, 6811, 2211, 6893, 2440, 29892, 372, 756, 11233, 287, 29871, 29947, 29946, 29955, 2305, 29889, 1383, 4512, 505, 1063, 4240, 7200, 975, 931, 29892, 577, 1269, 716, 7751, 756, 8951, 408, 1784, 2305, 408, 278, 1833, 7751, 29889, 1128, 1784, 2305, 892, 373, 278, 7751, 278, 1601, 2475, 263, 371, 297, 278, 937, 6893, 2440, 29973, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 1284, 278, 1234, 29889, 1334, 1073, 393, 278, 1601, 2475, 1136, 9351, 263, 7751, 1432, 6893, 2440, 29892, 322, 1269, 7751, 756, 8951, 408, 1784, 2305, 408, 278, 3517, 697, 29889, 7857, 29892, 278, 1353, 310, 2305, 373, 278, 7751, 11233, 287, 297, 278, 937, 6893, 2440, 338, 4203, 278, 1353, 310, 2305, 11233, 287, 975, 278, 4152, 29871, 29941, 29900, 29900, 29899, 6360, 3785, 29889, 13, 22550, 29901, 29871, 29946, 29906, 29941, 313, 1666, 2818, 411, 263, 2323, 938, 995, 29897], ""total_duration"": 109881579559, ""load_duration"": 19287534024, ""prompt_eval_count"": 196, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1642818000, ""eval_count"": 186, ""eval_duration"": 88935711000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 196, ""completion_tokens"": 186, ""total_tokens"": 382}}]","ValueError: ('Too many retries trying to get the correct output format.

After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the answer.\n\nFirst, we know that Tobias has been saving up his money for three months, so he has a total of $15 + $15 + $15 = $45 from his allowance.\n\nSecond, we know that he charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel a driveway. If he mows 4 lawns, he will earn $15 x 4 = $60.\n\nThird, we know that after buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. This means that he spent $95 - $15 = $80 on the shoes.\n\nFinally, we can set up an equation to represent the information given:\n\n$45 + $60 = $80\n\nSolving for x (the number of driveways he shoveled), we get:\n\nx = $60 - $45\nx = $15\n\nTherefore, Tobias shoveled 15 driveways.\n\nAnswer: 15""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama2:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T03:55:41.634055278Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [518, 25580, 29962, 3532, 14816, 29903, 29958, 5299, 829, 14816, 29903, 6778, 13, 13, 29954, 5428, 278, 4235, 421, 12470, 1673, 7738, 278, 4235, 421, 12011, 1412, 13, 13, 5634, 13, 13, 29943, 2952, 278, 1494, 3402, 29889, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 6435, 12470, 29913, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 6435, 5498, 346, 278, 1234, 1836, 1334, 2023, 13, 22550, 29901, 6435, 12011, 29913, 313, 1666, 2818, 411, 263, 2323, 938, 995, 29897, 13, 13, 5634, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 22354, 3173, 338, 1321, 5414, 263, 716, 5101, 310, 17394, 267, 393, 21544, 395, 29929, 29945, 29889, 940, 756, 1063, 14238, 701, 670, 6909, 1269, 4098, 363, 278, 4940, 2211, 7378, 29889, 940, 4947, 263, 395, 29945, 2758, 749, 263, 4098, 29889, 940, 884, 286, 1242, 425, 1233, 29879, 322, 528, 586, 1379, 7899, 1994, 29889, 940, 21090, 395, 29896, 29945, 304, 286, 340, 263, 425, 1233, 322, 395, 29955, 304, 528, 586, 295, 29889, 2860, 1321, 5414, 278, 17394, 267, 29892, 540, 756, 395, 29896, 29945, 297, 1735, 29889, 960, 540, 286, 1242, 29871, 29946, 425, 1233, 29879, 29892, 920, 1784, 7899, 1994, 1258, 540, 528, 586, 295, 29973, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 518, 29914, 25580, 29962, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 22354, 3173, 338, 1321, 5414, 263, 716, 5101, 310, 17394, 267, 393, 21544, 395, 29929, 29945, 29889, 940, 756, 1063, 14238, 701, 670, 6909, 1269, 4098, 363, 278, 4940, 2211, 7378, 29889, 940, 4947, 263, 395, 29945, 2758, 749, 263, 4098, 29889, 940, 884, 286, 1242, 425, 1233, 29879, 322, 528, 586, 1379, 7899, 1994, 29889, 940, 21090, 395, 29896, 29945, 304, 286, 340, 263, 425, 1233, 322, 395, 29955, 304, 528, 586, 295, 29889, 2860, 1321, 5414, 278, 17394, 267, 29892, 540, 756, 395, 29896, 29945, 297, 1735, 29889, 960, 540, 286, 1242, 29871, 29946, 425, 1233, 29879, 29892, 920, 1784, 7899, 1994, 1258, 540, 528, 586, 295, 29973, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 1284, 278, 1234, 29889, 13, 13, 6730, 29892, 591, 1073, 393, 22354, 3173, 756, 1063, 14238, 701, 670, 6909, 363, 2211, 7378, 29892, 577, 540, 756, 263, 3001, 310, 395, 29896, 29945, 718, 395, 29896, 29945, 718, 395, 29896, 29945, 353, 395, 29946, 29945, 515, 670, 2758, 749, 29889, 13, 13, 11863, 29892, 591, 1073, 393, 540, 21090, 395, 29896, 29945, 304, 286, 340, 263, 425, 1233, 322, 395, 29955, 304, 528, 586, 295, 263, 7899, 1582, 29889, 960, 540, 286, 1242, 29871, 29946, 425, 1233, 29879, 29892, 540, 674, 2326, 29876, 395, 29896, 29945, 921, 29871, 29946, 353, 395, 29953, 29900, 29889, 13, 13, 1349, 1823, 29892, 591, 1073, 393, 1156, 1321, 5414, 278, 17394, 267, 29892, 540, 756, 395, 29896, 29945, 297, 1735, 29889, 910, 2794, 393, 540, 10398, 395, 29929, 29945, 448, 395, 29896, 29945, 353, 395, 29947, 29900, 373, 278, 17394, 267, 29889, 13, 13, 12881, 635, 29892, 591, 508, 731, 701, 385, 6306, 304, 2755, 278, 2472, 2183, 29901, 13, 13, 29938, 29946, 29945, 718, 395, 29953, 29900, 353, 395, 29947, 29900, 13, 13, 13296, 1747, 363, 921, 313, 1552, 1353, 310, 7899, 1994, 540, 528, 994, 839, 511, 591, 679, 29901, 13, 13, 29916, 353, 395, 29953, 29900, 448, 395, 29946, 29945, 13, 29916, 353, 395, 29896, 29945, 13, 13, 8439, 1079, 29892, 22354, 3173, 528, 994, 839, 29871, 29896, 29945, 7899, 1994, 29889, 13, 13, 22550, 29901, 29871, 29896, 29945], ""total_duration"": 196638915649, ""load_duration"": 19094005520, ""prompt_eval_count"": 221, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1659133000, ""eval_count"": 366, ""eval_duration"": 175884709000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 221, ""completion_tokens"": 366, ""total_tokens"": 587}}]",

Now, we add the number of mango trees and coconut trees to find the total number of trees on Randy's farm: 60 + 55 = 115. Therefore, Randy has 115 trees in all on his farm.\nAnswer: 115 (Respond with a single int value)""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama2:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T04:11:20.695581426Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [518, 25580, 29962, 3532, 14816, 29903, 29958, 5299, 829, 14816, 29903, 6778, 13, 13, 29954, 5428, 278, 4235, 421, 12470, 1673, 7738, 278, 4235, 421, 12011, 1412, 13, 13, 5634, 13, 13, 29943, 2952, 278, 1494, 3402, 29889, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 6435, 12470, 29913, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 6435, 5498, 346, 278, 1234, 1836, 1334, 2023, 13, 22550, 29901, 6435, 12011, 29913, 313, 1666, 2818, 411, 263, 2323, 938, 995, 29897, 13, 13, 5634, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 390, 13910, 756, 29871, 29953, 29900, 286, 4524, 10697, 373, 670, 17888, 29889, 940, 884, 756, 29871, 29945, 3109, 1135, 4203, 408, 1784, 1302, 535, 329, 10697, 408, 286, 4524, 10697, 29889, 1128, 1784, 10697, 947, 390, 13910, 505, 297, 599, 373, 670, 17888, 29973, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 518, 29914, 25580, 29962, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 390, 13910, 756, 29871, 29953, 29900, 286, 4524, 10697, 373, 670, 17888, 29889, 940, 884, 756, 29871, 29945, 3109, 1135, 4203, 408, 1784, 1302, 535, 329, 10697, 408, 286, 4524, 10697, 29889, 1128, 1784, 10697, 947, 390, 13910, 505, 297, 599, 373, 670, 17888, 29973, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 1284, 278, 1234, 29889, 1334, 1073, 393, 390, 13910, 756, 29871, 29953, 29900, 286, 4524, 10697, 29892, 322, 540, 756, 29871, 29945, 28145, 1302, 535, 329, 10697, 1135, 286, 4524, 10697, 29889, 1105, 29892, 565, 591, 1246, 278, 1353, 310, 1302, 535, 329, 10697, 376, 29916, 613, 769, 591, 508, 1827, 393, 921, 353, 29871, 29953, 29900, 448, 29871, 29945, 353, 29871, 29945, 29945, 29889, 2567, 29892, 591, 788, 278, 1353, 310, 286, 4524, 10697, 322, 1302, 535, 329, 10697, 304, 1284, 278, 3001, 1353, 310, 10697, 373, 390, 13910, 29915, 29879, 17888, 29901, 29871, 29953, 29900, 718, 29871, 29945, 29945, 353, 29871, 29896, 29896, 29945, 29889, 7857, 29892, 390, 13910, 756, 29871, 29896, 29896, 29945, 10697, 297, 599, 373, 670, 17888, 29889, 13, 22550, 29901, 29871, 29896, 29896, 29945, 313, 1666, 2818, 411, 263, 2323, 938, 995, 29897], ""total_duration"": 117647350808, ""load_duration"": 19379215433, ""prompt_eval_count"": 156, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1590522000, ""eval_count"": 203, ""eval_duration"": 96666167000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 156, ""completion_tokens"": 203, ""total_tokens"": 359}}]","ValueError: ('Too many retries trying to get the correct output format.

How much does he spend on the ingredients?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total cost of the ingredients.\nFirst, we know that the cheddar cheese costs $10 per 2 pounds, so the cost per pound is $10/2 = $5 per pound.\nThe cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, so it costs $5/2 = $2.50 per pound.\nThe cold cuts cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese, so they cost $10 x 2 = $20 per pack.\nNow, we need to calculate the total cost of all the ingredients:\nTotal cost = (2 pounds cheddar cheese x $5/pound) + (1 pound cream cheese x $2.50/pound) + (1 pack cold cuts x $20/pack)\nTotal cost = $10 + $2.50 + $20 = $32.50\nAnswer: Jasper spends $32.50 on the ingredients.""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama2:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T04:21:40.58395667Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [518, 25580, 29962, 3532, 14816, 29903, 29958, 5299, 829, 14816, 29903, 6778, 13, 13, 29954, 5428, 278, 4235, 421, 12470, 1673, 7738, 278, 4235, 421, 12011, 1412, 13, 13, 5634, 13, 13, 29943, 2952, 278, 1494, 3402, 29889, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 6435, 12470, 29913, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 6435, 5498, 346, 278, 1234, 1836, 1334, 2023, 13, 22550, 29901, 6435, 12011, 29913, 313, 1666, 2818, 411, 263, 2323, 938, 995, 29897, 13, 13, 5634, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 28725, 546, 674, 9080, 1373, 7582, 10681, 472, 670, 17803, 6263, 29889, 940, 1321, 952, 29871, 29906, 24261, 310, 521, 287, 16702, 923, 968, 363, 395, 29896, 29900, 29892, 263, 282, 618, 310, 907, 314, 923, 968, 393, 3438, 4203, 278, 8666, 310, 278, 521, 287, 16702, 923, 968, 29892, 322, 263, 4870, 310, 11220, 5700, 29879, 393, 3438, 8951, 278, 8666, 310, 278, 521, 287, 16702, 923, 968, 29889, 1128, 1568, 947, 540, 18864, 373, 278, 2348, 1127, 10070, 29973, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 518, 29914, 25580, 29962, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 28725, 546, 674, 9080, 1373, 7582, 10681, 472, 670, 17803, 6263, 29889, 940, 1321, 952, 29871, 29906, 24261, 310, 521, 287, 16702, 923, 968, 363, 395, 29896, 29900, 29892, 263, 282, 618, 310, 907, 314, 923, 968, 393, 3438, 4203, 278, 8666, 310, 278, 521, 287, 16702, 923, 968, 29892, 322, 263, 4870, 310, 11220, 5700, 29879, 393, 3438, 8951, 278, 8666, 310, 278, 521, 287, 16702, 923, 968, 29889, 1128, 1568, 947, 540, 18864, 373, 278, 2348, 1127, 10070, 29973, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 8147, 278, 3001, 3438, 310, 278, 2348, 1127, 10070, 29889, 13, 6730, 29892, 591, 1073, 393, 278, 521, 287, 16702, 923, 968, 21544, 395, 29896, 29900, 639, 29871, 29906, 24261, 29892, 577, 278, 3438, 639, 282, 618, 338, 395, 29896, 29900, 29914, 29906, 353, 395, 29945, 639, 282, 618, 29889, 13, 1576, 907, 314, 923, 968, 21544, 4203, 278, 8666, 310, 278, 521, 287, 16702, 923, 968, 29892, 577, 372, 21544, 395, 29945, 29914, 29906, 353, 395, 29906, 29889, 29945, 29900, 639, 282, 618, 29889, 13, 1576, 11220, 5700, 29879, 3438, 8951, 278, 8666, 310, 278, 521, 287, 16702, 923, 968, 29892, 577, 896, 3438, 395, 29896, 29900, 921, 29871, 29906, 353, 395, 29906, 29900, 639, 4870, 29889, 13, 10454, 29892, 591, 817, 304, 8147, 278, 3001, 3438, 310, 599, 278, 2348, 1127, 10070, 29901, 13, 11536, 3438, 353, 313, 29906, 24261, 521, 287, 16702, 923, 968, 921, 395, 29945, 29914, 29886, 618, 29897, 718, 313, 29896, 282, 618, 907, 314, 923, 968, 921, 395, 29906, 29889, 29945, 29900, 29914, 29886, 618, 29897, 718, 313, 29896, 4870, 11220, 5700, 29879, 921, 395, 29906, 29900, 29914, 4058, 29897, 13, 11536, 3438, 353, 395, 29896, 29900, 718, 395, 29906, 29889, 29945, 29900, 718, 395, 29906, 29900, 353, 395, 29941, 29906, 29889, 29945, 29900, 13, 22550, 29901, 28725, 546, 805, 1975, 395, 29941, 29906, 29889, 29945, 29900, 373, 278, 2348, 1127, 10070, 29889], ""total_duration"": 178687889012, ""load_duration"": 19058369554, ""prompt_eval_count"": 192, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1674952000, ""eval_count"": 330, ""eval_duration"": 157950678000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 192, ""completion_tokens"": 330, ""total_tokens"": 522}}]","ValueError: ('Too many retries trying to get the correct output format.

How much does he spend on the ingredients?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total amount spent. First, we need to find out how much Jasper paid for each item. The 2 pounds of cheddar cheese cost $10, so that is a straightforward calculation. Next, since the cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, and the cheddar cheese was $10 for 2 pounds (meaning it's $5 per pound), then the cream cheese would be $5 / 2 = $2.50. Lastly, the pack of cold cuts cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese, which is $10 * 2 = $20.\nAnswer: 32""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama3.1:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T04:28:35.187146364Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 22818, 279, 5151, 1595, 7998, 7964, 8356, 279, 5151, 1595, 9399, 63438, 45464, 12763, 279, 2768, 3645, 382, 14924, 25, 3654, 7998, 534, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 3654, 98374, 279, 4320, 7966, 1226, 12515, 16533, 25, 3654, 9399, 92, 320, 66454, 449, 264, 3254, 528, 907, 696, 45464, 14924, 25, 71584, 690, 8854, 1181, 10453, 27197, 520, 813, 14177, 4717, 13, 1283, 50631, 220, 17, 16701, 315, 523, 78716, 17604, 369, 400, 605, 11, 264, 31123, 315, 12932, 17604, 430, 2853, 4376, 279, 3430, 315, 279, 523, 78716, 17604, 11, 323, 264, 3854, 315, 9439, 15455, 430, 2853, 11157, 279, 3430, 315, 279, 523, 78716, 17604, 13, 2650, 1790, 1587, 568, 8493, 389, 279, 14293, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 14924, 25, 71584, 690, 8854, 1181, 10453, 27197, 520, 813, 14177, 4717, 13, 1283, 50631, 220, 17, 16701, 315, 523, 78716, 17604, 369, 400, 605, 11, 264, 31123, 315, 12932, 17604, 430, 2853, 4376, 279, 3430, 315, 279, 523, 78716, 17604, 11, 323, 264, 3854, 315, 9439, 15455, 430, 2853, 11157, 279, 3430, 315, 279, 523, 78716, 17604, 13, 2650, 1790, 1587, 568, 8493, 389, 279, 14293, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 11294, 279, 2860, 3392, 7543, 13, 5629, 11, 584, 1205, 311, 1505, 704, 1268, 1790, 71584, 7318, 369, 1855, 1537, 13, 578, 220, 17, 16701, 315, 523, 78716, 17604, 2853, 400, 605, 11, 779, 430, 374, 264, 31439, 22702, 13, 9479, 11, 2533, 279, 12932, 17604, 7194, 4376, 279, 3430, 315, 279, 523, 78716, 17604, 11, 323, 279, 523, 78716, 17604, 574, 400, 605, 369, 220, 17, 16701, 320, 57865, 433, 596, 400, 20, 824, 31123, 705, 1243, 279, 12932, 17604, 1053, 387, 400, 20, 611, 220, 17, 284, 400, 17, 13, 1135, 13, 71809, 11, 279, 3854, 315, 9439, 15455, 2853, 11157, 279, 3430, 315, 279, 523, 78716, 17604, 11, 902, 374, 400, 605, 353, 220, 17, 284, 400, 508, 627, 16533, 25, 220, 843], ""total_duration"": 133310371639, ""load_duration"": 20302039256, ""prompt_eval_count"": 146, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1726925000, ""eval_count"": 207, ""eval_duration"": 111235165000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 146, ""completion_tokens"": 207, ""total_tokens"": 353}}]",

Question: James creates a media empire.  He creates a movie for $2000.  Each DVD cost $6 to make.  He sells it for 2.5 times that much.  He sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week.  How much profit does he make in 20 weeks?
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to","[{""id"": ""chatcmpl-da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709"", ""object"": ""chat.completion"", ""created"": 1728362987, ""model"": ""llama3.1:70b"", ""choices"": [{""index"": 0, ""message"": {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""Question: James creates a media empire.

How much profit does he make in 20 weeks?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate James' total profit. First, we need to find out how much he makes from selling one DVD. Since he sells it for 2.5 times the cost of making it, which is $6, he sells each DVD for 2.5 * $6 = $15. His profit per DVD is then $15 - $6 = $9. Next, we need to calculate how many DVDs he sells in a week: 500 movies/day * 5 days/week = 2500 movies/week. Since there are 20 weeks, the total number of DVDs sold is 2500 movies/week * 20 weeks = 50,000 movies. Now, let's find out his total profit from selling these DVDs: $9/movie * 50,000 movies = $450,000. However, we also need to subtract the initial cost of making the movie, which is $2000. Therefore, James' total profit in 20 weeks is $450,000 - $2000 = $448,000.\nAnswer: 448000""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama3.1:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T04:52:50.281727501Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 22818, 279, 5151, 1595, 7998, 7964, 8356, 279, 5151, 1595, 9399, 63438, 45464, 12763, 279, 2768, 3645, 382, 14924, 25, 3654, 7998, 534, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 3654, 98374, 279, 4320, 7966, 1226, 12515, 16533, 25, 3654, 9399, 92, 320, 66454, 449, 264, 3254, 528, 907, 696, 45464, 14924, 25, 7957, 11705, 264, 3772, 32447, 13, 220, 1283, 11705, 264, 5818, 369, 400, 1049, 15, 13, 220, 9062, 18584, 2853, 400, 21, 311, 1304, 13, 220, 1283, 31878, 433, 369, 220, 17, 13, 20, 3115, 430, 1790, 13, 220, 1283, 31878, 220, 2636, 9698, 264, 1938, 369, 220, 20, 2919, 264, 2046, 13, 220, 2650, 1790, 11626, 1587, 568, 1304, 304, 220, 508, 5672, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 14924, 25, 7957, 11705, 264, 3772, 32447, 13, 220, 1283, 11705, 264, 5818, 369, 400, 1049, 15, 13, 220, 9062, 18584, 2853, 400, 21, 311, 1304, 13, 220, 1283, 31878, 433, 369, 220, 17, 13, 20, 3115, 430, 1790, 13, 220, 1283, 31878, 220, 2636, 9698, 264, 1938, 369, 220, 20, 2919, 264, 2046, 13, 220, 2650, 1790, 11626, 1587, 568, 1304, 304, 220, 508, 5672, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 11294, 7957, 6, 2860, 11626, 13, 5629, 11, 584, 1205, 311, 1505, 704, 1268, 1790, 568, 3727, 505, 11486, 832, 18584, 13, 8876, 568, 31878, 433, 369, 220, 17, 13, 20, 3115, 279, 2853, 315, 3339, 433, 11, 902, 374, 400, 21, 11, 568, 31878, 1855, 18584, 369, 220, 17, 13, 20, 353, 400, 21, 284, 400, 868, 13, 5414, 11626, 824, 18584, 374, 1243, 400, 868, 482, 400, 21, 284, 400, 24, 13, 9479, 11, 584, 1205, 311, 11294, 1268, 1690, 64436, 568, 31878, 304, 264, 2046, 25, 220, 2636, 9698, 45839, 353, 220, 20, 2919, 14, 10476, 284, 220, 5154, 15, 9698, 14, 10476, 13, 8876, 1070, 527, 220, 508, 5672, 11, 279, 2860, 1396, 315, 64436, 6216, 374, 220, 5154, 15, 9698, 14, 10476, 353, 220, 508, 5672, 284, 220, 1135, 11, 931, 9698, 13, 4800, 11, 1095, 596, 1505, 704, 813, 2860, 11626, 505, 11486, 1521, 64436, 25, 400, 24, 72877, 353, 220, 1135, 11, 931, 9698, 284, 400, 10617, 11, 931, 13, 4452, 11, 584, 1101, 1205, 311, 33356, 279, 2926, 2853, 315, 3339, 279, 5818, 11, 902, 374, 400, 1049, 15, 13, 15636, 11, 7957, 6, 2860, 11626, 304, 220, 508, 5672, 374, 400, 10617, 11, 931, 482, 400, 1049, 15, 284, 400, 19956, 11, 931, 627, 16533, 25, 220, 19956, 931], ""total_duration"": 183104313243, ""load_duration"": 20373943758, ""prompt_eval_count"": 145, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1685870000, ""eval_count"": 298, ""eval_duration"": 161038500000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 145, ""completion_tokens"": 298, ""total_tokens"": 443}}]",

The total number of pink hard hats taken away is 4 + 6 = 10. The total number of green hard hats taken away is 12. \n\nNow, let's subtract the number of hard hats taken away from the initial number of hard hats in the truck. There were initially 26 pink hard hats, so after Carl and John took some away, there are 26 - 10 = 16 pink hard hats left. There were initially 15 green hard hats, so after John took some away, there are 15 - 12 = 3 green hard hats left.\n\nThe number of yellow hard hats remained the same since neither Carl nor John touched them. So, we still have 24 yellow hard hats.\n\nFinally, let's add up all the remaining hard hats to find the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck: 16 pink + 3 green + 24 yellow = 43.\n\nAnswer: 43""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama3.1:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T05:14:38.687616593Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 22818, 279, 5151, 1595, 7998, 7964, 8356, 279, 5151, 1595, 9399, 63438, 45464, 12763, 279, 2768, 3645, 382, 14924, 25, 3654, 7998, 534, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 3654, 98374, 279, 4320, 7966, 1226, 12515, 16533, 25, 3654, 9399, 92, 320, 66454, 449, 264, 3254, 528, 907, 696, 45464, 14924, 25, 763, 264, 11092, 11, 1070, 527, 220, 1627, 18718, 2653, 45526, 11, 220, 868, 6307, 2653, 45526, 11, 323, 220, 1187, 14071, 2653, 45526, 13, 220, 1442, 22770, 5097, 3201, 220, 19, 18718, 2653, 45526, 11, 323, 3842, 5097, 3201, 220, 21, 18718, 2653, 45526, 323, 11157, 439, 1690, 6307, 2653, 45526, 439, 279, 1396, 315, 18718, 2653, 45526, 430, 568, 7108, 11, 1243, 11294, 279, 2860, 1396, 315, 2653, 45526, 430, 14958, 304, 279, 11092, 627, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 1131, 36697, 279, 2860, 1396, 315, 2653, 45526, 430, 14958, 304, 279, 11092, 13, 5629, 11, 584, 1205, 311, 1505, 704, 1268, 1690, 2653, 45526, 1051, 4529, 3201, 555, 22770, 323, 3842, 13, 22770, 3952, 220, 19, 18718, 2653, 45526, 13, 3842, 3952, 220, 21, 18718, 2653, 45526, 323, 11157, 439, 1690, 6307, 2653, 45526, 439, 279, 1396, 315, 18718, 2653, 45526, 568, 7108, 11, 902, 374, 220, 17, 865, 220, 21, 284, 220, 717, 6307, 2653, 45526, 382, 5971, 11, 584, 1205, 311, 11294, 279, 2860, 1396, 315, 2653, 45526, 4529, 3201, 555, 2225, 22770, 323, 3842, 13, 578, 2860, 1396, 315, 18718, 2653, 45526, 4529, 3201, 374, 220, 19, 489, 220, 21, 284, 220, 605, 13, 578, 2860, 1396, 315, 6307, 2653, 45526, 4529, 3201, 374, 220, 717, 13, 4815, 7184, 11, 1095, 596, 33356, 279, 1396, 315, 2653, 45526, 4529, 3201, 505, 279, 2926, 1396, 315, 2653, 45526, 304, 279, 11092, 13, 2684, 1051, 15453, 220, 1627, 18718, 2653, 45526, 11, 779, 1306, 22770, 323, 3842, 3952, 1063, 3201, 11, 1070, 527, 220, 1627, 482, 220, 605, 284, 220, 845, 18718, 2653, 45526, 2163, 13, 2684, 1051, 15453, 220, 868, 6307, 2653, 45526, 11, 779, 1306, 3842, 3952, 1063, 3201, 11, 1070, 527, 220, 868, 482, 220, 717, 284, 220, 18, 6307, 2653, 45526, 2163, 382, 791, 1396, 315, 14071, 2653, 45526, 14958, 279, 1890, 2533, 14188, 22770, 6463, 3842, 24891, 1124, 13, 2100, 11, 584, 2103, 617, 220, 1187, 14071, 2653, 45526, 382, 24901, 11, 1095, 596, 923, 709, 682, 279, 9861, 2653, 45526, 311, 1505, 279, 2860, 1396, 315, 2653, 45526, 430, 14958, 304, 279, 11092, 25, 220, 845, 18718, 489, 220, 18, 6307, 489, 220, 1187, 14071, 284, 220, 3391, 382, 16533, 25, 220, 3391], ""total_duration"": 179417808485, ""load_duration"": 20272797678, ""prompt_eval_count"": 157, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1702986000, ""eval_count"": 292, ""eval_duration"": 157392430000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 157, ""completion_tokens"": 292, ""total_tokens"": 449}}]",

When Roque walks, , it takes him 2 hours one way, 4 hours round trip. He does this three times a week, so that is 3 x 4 = 12 hours of walking. When he rides his bike, it takes him 1 hour one way and 2 hours round trip. He does this twice a week, so that is 2 x 2 = 4 hours of biking. In total, Roque spends 12 + 4 = 16 hours per week commuting.\nAnswer: 16""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama3:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T05:22:56.862950604Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 22818, 279, 5151, 1595, 7998, 7964, 8356, 279, 5151, 1595, 9399, 63438, 45464, 12763, 279, 2768, 3645, 382, 14924, 25, 3654, 7998, 534, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 3654, 98374, 279, 4320, 7966, 1226, 12515, 16533, 25, 3654, 9399, 92, 320, 66454, 449, 264, 3254, 528, 907, 696, 45464, 14924, 25, 1102, 5097, 12093, 593, 1403, 4207, 311, 4321, 311, 990, 323, 832, 6596, 311, 12141, 813, 13260, 311, 990, 13, 12093, 593, 23291, 311, 323, 505, 990, 2380, 3115, 264, 2046, 323, 32327, 813, 13260, 311, 323, 505, 990, 11157, 264, 2046, 13, 2650, 1690, 4207, 304, 2860, 1587, 568, 1935, 311, 636, 311, 323, 505, 990, 264, 2046, 449, 11689, 323, 67180, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 14924, 25, 1102, 5097, 12093, 593, 1403, 4207, 311, 4321, 311, 990, 323, 832, 6596, 311, 12141, 813, 13260, 311, 990, 13, 12093, 593, 23291, 311, 323, 505, 990, 2380, 3115, 264, 2046, 323, 32327, 813, 13260, 311, 323, 505, 990, 11157, 264, 2046, 13, 2650, 1690, 4207, 304, 2860, 1587, 568, 1935, 311, 636, 311, 323, 505, 990, 264, 2046, 449, 11689, 323, 67180, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 1505, 279, 2860, 4207, 7543, 389, 94950, 824, 2046, 13, 3277, 12093, 593, 23291, 11, 1174, 433, 5097, 1461, 220, 17, 4207, 832, 1648, 11, 220, 19, 4207, 4883, 8577, 13, 1283, 1587, 420, 2380, 3115, 264, 2046, 11, 779, 430, 374, 220, 18, 865, 220, 19, 284, 220, 717, 4207, 315, 11689, 13, 3277, 568, 32327, 813, 13260, 11, 433, 5097, 1461, 220, 16, 6596, 832, 1648, 323, 220, 17, 4207, 4883, 8577, 13, 1283, 1587, 420, 11157, 264, 2046, 11, 779, 430, 374, 220, 17, 865, 220, 17, 284, 220, 19, 4207, 315, 67180, 13, 763, 2860, 11, 12093, 593, 38202, 220, 717, 489, 220, 19, 284, 220, 845, 4207, 824, 2046, 94950, 627, 16533, 25, 220, 845], ""total_duration"": 120223468420, ""load_duration"": 19619953133, ""prompt_eval_count"": 144, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1689138000, ""eval_count"": 199, ""eval_duration"": 98866595000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 144, ""completion_tokens"": 199, ""total_tokens"": 343}}]",

His work is 20 miles away. He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles. If he can bike at 25 mph, how much time does he spend biking a week?\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the time Tim spends biking each week.\n\n1. First, let's calculate the distance Tim travels each day. Since he rides back and forth to work, he covers a total distance of 20 miles x 2 = 40 miles per day.\n2. Next, let's calculate the time it takes Tim to commute to work each day. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is 40 miles, and the speed is 25 mph, so Time = 40 miles / 25 mph = 1.6 hours per day.\n3. Since Tim works 5 days a week, he spends 1.6 hours/day x 5 days = 8 hours per week commuting to work.\n4. Now, let's calculate the time Tim spends on his weekend bike ride. The distance is 200 miles, and the speed is still 25 mph. Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 25 mph = 8 hours.\n5. Finally, let's add up the time Tim spends biking each week: 8 hours (commuting) + 8 hours (weekend ride) = 16 hours per week.\n\nAnswer: 16 hours per week (Respond with a single int value)""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama2:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T05:32:46.530556467Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [518, 25580, 29962, 3532, 14816, 29903, 29958, 5299, 829, 14816, 29903, 6778, 13, 13, 29954, 5428, 278, 4235, 421, 12470, 1673, 7738, 278, 4235, 421, 12011, 1412, 13, 13, 5634, 13, 13, 29943, 2952, 278, 1494, 3402, 29889, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 6435, 12470, 29913, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 6435, 5498, 346, 278, 1234, 1836, 1334, 2023, 13, 22550, 29901, 6435, 12011, 29913, 313, 1666, 2818, 411, 263, 2323, 938, 995, 29897, 13, 13, 5634, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 7870, 364, 2247, 670, 4768, 446, 1250, 322, 11483, 304, 664, 363, 1269, 310, 670, 29871, 29945, 664, 16700, 29889, 29871, 3600, 664, 338, 29871, 29906, 29900, 7800, 3448, 29889, 29871, 940, 884, 5771, 363, 263, 4723, 355, 4768, 446, 22203, 310, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29900, 7800, 29889, 1678, 960, 540, 508, 4768, 446, 472, 29871, 29906, 29945, 286, 561, 920, 1568, 931, 947, 540, 18864, 289, 638, 292, 263, 4723, 29973, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 518, 29914, 25580, 29962, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 7870, 364, 2247, 670, 4768, 446, 1250, 322, 11483, 304, 664, 363, 1269, 310, 670, 29871, 29945, 664, 16700, 29889, 3600, 664, 338, 29871, 29906, 29900, 7800, 3448, 29889, 940, 884, 5771, 363, 263, 4723, 355, 4768, 446, 22203, 310, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29900, 7800, 29889, 960, 540, 508, 4768, 446, 472, 29871, 29906, 29945, 286, 561, 29892, 920, 1568, 931, 947, 540, 18864, 289, 638, 292, 263, 4723, 29973, 13, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 8147, 278, 931, 7870, 805, 1975, 289, 638, 292, 1269, 4723, 29889, 13, 13, 29896, 29889, 3824, 29892, 1235, 29915, 29879, 8147, 278, 5418, 7870, 9850, 29879, 1269, 2462, 29889, 4001, 540, 364, 2247, 1250, 322, 11483, 304, 664, 29892, 540, 18469, 263, 3001, 5418, 310, 29871, 29906, 29900, 7800, 921, 29871, 29906, 353, 29871, 29946, 29900, 7800, 639, 2462, 29889, 13, 29906, 29889, 8084, 29892, 1235, 29915, 29879, 8147, 278, 931, 372, 4893, 7870, 304, 844, 1082, 304, 664, 1269, 2462, 29889, 1334, 508, 671, 278, 7063, 29901, 5974, 353, 6652, 749, 847, 24839, 29889, 512, 445, 1206, 29892, 278, 5418, 338, 29871, 29946, 29900, 7800, 29892, 322, 278, 6210, 338, 29871, 29906, 29945, 286, 561, 29892, 577, 5974, 353, 29871, 29946, 29900, 7800, 847, 29871, 29906, 29945, 286, 561, 353, 29871, 29896, 29889, 29953, 6199, 639, 2462, 29889, 13, 29941, 29889, 4001, 7870, 1736, 29871, 29945, 3841, 263, 4723, 29892, 540, 805, 1975, 29871, 29896, 29889, 29953, 6199, 29914, 3250, 921, 29871, 29945, 3841, 353, 29871, 29947, 6199, 639, 4723, 844, 17068, 304, 664, 29889, 13, 29946, 29889, 2567, 29892, 1235, 29915, 29879, 8147, 278, 931, 7870, 805, 1975, 373, 670, 4723, 355, 4768, 446, 22203, 29889, 450, 5418, 338, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29900, 7800, 29892, 322, 278, 6210, 338, 1603, 29871, 29906, 29945, 286, 561, 29889, 5974, 353, 6652, 749, 847, 24839, 353, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29900, 7800, 847, 29871, 29906, 29945, 286, 561, 353, 29871, 29947, 6199, 29889, 13, 29945, 29889, 9788, 29892, 1235, 29915, 29879, 788, 701, 278, 931, 7870, 805, 1975, 289, 638, 292, 1269, 4723, 29901, 29871, 29947, 6199, 313, 2055, 17068, 29897, 718, 29871, 29947, 6199, 313, 18448, 355, 22203, 29897, 353, 29871, 29896, 29953, 6199, 639, 4723, 29889, 13, 13, 22550, 29901, 29871, 29896, 29953, 6199, 639, 4723, 313, 1666, 2818, 411, 263, 2323, 938, 995, 29897], ""total_duration"": 212303156410, ""load_duration"": 19566064151, ""prompt_eval_count"": 183, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1653154000, ""eval_count"": 396, ""eval_duration"": 191032941000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 183, ""completion_tokens"": 396, ""total_tokens"": 579}}]","ValueError: ('Too many retries trying to get the correct output format.

He bikes back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays, so that's 2 trips per day, with each trip being 20 miles. That's a total of 2 x 20 = 40 miles per day. Since he does this for 5 days, the total distance is 40 x 5 = 200 miles. He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.

His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total distance Tim bikes and then divide it by his speed to find the total time spent biking. First, we need to calculate the total distance biked during workdays. Since Tim rides back and forth, the daily commute is 2 * 20 = 40 miles. For 5 days, this amounts to 5 * 40 = 200 miles. Adding the weekend ride of 200 miles, the total weekly distance is 200 + 200 = 400 miles. Now, we can calculate the time spent biking by dividing the total distance by Tim's speed: 400 miles / 25 mph.\nAnswer: 16""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama3.1:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-08T05:40:51.333804691Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 22818, 279, 5151, 1595, 7998, 7964, 8356, 279, 5151, 1595, 9399, 63438, 45464, 12763, 279, 2768, 3645, 382, 14924, 25, 3654, 7998, 534, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 3654, 98374, 279, 4320, 7966, 1226, 12515, 16533, 25, 3654, 9399, 92, 320, 66454, 449, 264, 3254, 528, 907, 696, 45464, 14924, 25, 9538, 32327, 813, 13260, 1203, 323, 13544, 311, 990, 369, 1855, 315, 813, 220, 20, 990, 14097, 13, 220, 5414, 990, 374, 220, 508, 8931, 3201, 13, 220, 1283, 1101, 5900, 369, 264, 9178, 13260, 12141, 315, 220, 1049, 8931, 13, 262, 1442, 568, 649, 13260, 520, 220, 914, 35061, 1268, 1790, 892, 1587, 568, 8493, 67180, 264, 2046, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 14924, 25, 9538, 32327, 813, 13260, 1203, 323, 13544, 311, 990, 369, 1855, 315, 813, 220, 20, 990, 14097, 13, 220, 5414, 990, 374, 220, 508, 8931, 3201, 13, 220, 1283, 1101, 5900, 369, 264, 9178, 13260, 12141, 315, 220, 1049, 8931, 13, 262, 1442, 568, 649, 13260, 520, 220, 914, 35061, 1268, 1790, 892, 1587, 568, 8493, 67180, 264, 2046, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 11294, 279, 2860, 6138, 9538, 31553, 323, 1243, 22497, 433, 555, 813, 4732, 311, 1505, 279, 2860, 892, 7543, 67180, 13, 5629, 11, 584, 1205, 311, 11294, 279, 2860, 6138, 38645, 291, 2391, 990, 14097, 13, 8876, 9538, 32327, 1203, 323, 13544, 11, 279, 7446, 59263, 374, 220, 17, 353, 220, 508, 284, 220, 1272, 8931, 13, 1789, 220, 20, 2919, 11, 420, 15055, 311, 220, 20, 353, 220, 1272, 284, 220, 1049, 8931, 13, 31470, 279, 9178, 12141, 315, 220, 1049, 8931, 11, 279, 2860, 17496, 6138, 374, 220, 1049, 489, 220, 1049, 284, 220, 3443, 8931, 13, 4800, 11, 584, 649, 11294, 279, 892, 7543, 67180, 555, 50802, 279, 2860, 6138, 555, 9538, 596, 4732, 25, 220, 3443, 8931, 611, 220, 914, 35061, 627, 16533, 25, 220, 845], ""total_duration"": 131370381483, ""load_duration"": 19913623833, ""prompt_eval_count"": 140, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1707848000, ""eval_count"": 205, ""eval_duration"": 109706940000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 140, ""completion_tokens"": 205, ""total_tokens"": 345}}]",
