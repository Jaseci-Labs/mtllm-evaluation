Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate Weng's earnings. First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 minutes is equal to 0.83 hours (50/60). Now, we can multiply the amount of time Weng worked by her hourly wage to get her total earnings.

Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the answer. We know that Julie read 12 pages yesterday, so the number of pages she has left to read is 120 - 12 = 108. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 2 \\* 12 = 24 pages. Therefore, the number of pages she has left to read tomorrow is 108 - 24 = 84.

How many pages does he write a year?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the answer. We know that James writes 2 letters per week, and each letter is 3 pages long. That means he writes 6 pages per week. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, James writes a total of 6 x 52 = 312 pages per year.\nAnswer: 312""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama2:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-01T02:34:37.095403384Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [518, 25580, 29962, 3532, 14816, 29903, 29958, 5299, 829, 14816, 29903, 6778, 13, 13, 29954, 5428, 278, 4235, 421, 12470, 1673, 7738, 278, 4235, 421, 12011, 1412, 13, 13, 5634, 13, 13, 29943, 2952, 278, 1494, 3402, 29889, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 6435, 12470, 29913, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 6435, 5498, 346, 278, 1234, 1836, 1334, 2023, 13, 22550, 29901, 6435, 12011, 29913, 313, 1666, 2818, 411, 263, 2323, 938, 995, 29897, 13, 13, 5634, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 5011, 15873, 263, 29871, 29941, 29899, 3488, 5497, 304, 29871, 29906, 1422, 7875, 8951, 263, 4723, 29889, 29871, 1128, 1784, 6515, 947, 540, 2436, 263, 1629, 29973, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 518, 29914, 25580, 29962, 13, 13, 16492, 29901, 5011, 15873, 263, 29871, 29941, 29899, 3488, 5497, 304, 29871, 29906, 1422, 7875, 8951, 263, 4723, 29889, 29871, 1128, 1784, 6515, 947, 540, 2436, 263, 1629, 29973, 13, 1123, 1658, 292, 29901, 2803, 29915, 29879, 1348, 4331, 491, 4331, 297, 1797, 304, 1284, 278, 1234, 29889, 1334, 1073, 393, 5011, 15873, 29871, 29906, 8721, 639, 4723, 29892, 322, 1269, 5497, 338, 29871, 29941, 6515, 1472, 29889, 2193, 2794, 540, 15873, 29871, 29953, 6515, 639, 4723, 29889, 4001, 727, 526, 29871, 29945, 29906, 11405, 297, 263, 1629, 29892, 5011, 15873, 263, 3001, 310, 29871, 29953, 921, 29871, 29945, 29906, 353, 29871, 29941, 29896, 29906, 6515, 639, 1629, 29889, 13, 22550, 29901, 29871, 29941, 29896, 29906], ""total_duration"": 77185633229, ""load_duration"": 19785539245, ""prompt_eval_count"": 138, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1605861000, ""eval_count"": 118, ""eval_duration"": 55750019000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 138, ""completion_tokens"": 118, ""total_tokens"": 256}}]",

Question: A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?

The cold cuts cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese, so they cost $20. To find the total cost, we add these amounts together: $10 + $5 + $20 = ...\nAnswer: 35""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama3:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-01T04:16:34.962375926Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 22818, 279, 5151, 1595, 7998, 7964, 8356, 279, 5151, 1595, 9399, 63438, 45464, 12763, 279, 2768, 3645, 382, 14924, 25, 3654, 7998, 534, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 3654, 98374, 279, 4320, 7966, 1226, 12515, 16533, 25, 3654, 9399, 92, 320, 66454, 449, 264, 3254, 528, 907, 696, 45464, 14924, 25, 71584, 690, 8854, 1181, 10453, 27197, 520, 813, 14177, 4717, 13, 1283, 50631, 220, 17, 16701, 315, 523, 78716, 17604, 369, 400, 605, 11, 264, 31123, 315, 12932, 17604, 430, 2853, 4376, 279, 3430, 315, 279, 523, 78716, 17604, 11, 323, 264, 3854, 315, 9439, 15455, 430, 2853, 11157, 279, 3430, 315, 279, 523, 78716, 17604, 13, 2650, 1790, 1587, 568, 8493, 389, 279, 14293, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 14924, 25, 71584, 690, 8854, 1181, 10453, 27197, 520, 813, 14177, 4717, 13, 1283, 50631, 220, 17, 16701, 315, 523, 78716, 17604, 369, 400, 605, 11, 264, 31123, 315, 12932, 17604, 430, 2853, 4376, 279, 3430, 315, 279, 523, 78716, 17604, 11, 323, 264, 3854, 315, 9439, 15455, 430, 2853, 11157, 279, 3430, 315, 279, 523, 78716, 17604, 13, 2650, 1790, 1587, 568, 8493, 389, 279, 14293, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 1505, 279, 2860, 2853, 13, 578, 523, 78716, 17604, 7194, 400, 605, 13, 578, 12932, 17604, 7194, 4376, 315, 430, 11, 902, 374, 400, 20, 13, 578, 9439, 15455, 2853, 11157, 279, 3430, 315, 279, 523, 78716, 17604, 11, 779, 814, 2853, 400, 508, 13, 2057, 1505, 279, 2860, 2853, 11, 584, 923, 1521, 15055, 3871, 25, 400, 605, 489, 400, 20, 489, 400, 508, 284, 12515, 16533, 25, 220, 1758], ""total_duration"": 96749504122, ""load_duration"": 19564247955, ""prompt_eval_count"": 146, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1688279000, ""eval_count"": 152, ""eval_duration"": 75443993000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 146, ""completion_tokens"": 152, ""total_tokens"": 298}}]",
