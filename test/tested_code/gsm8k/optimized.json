        "question": "Tim decides to cancel his cable subscription and get streaming services.  He gets Netflix for $10 a month.  Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 a month each but he saves 20% for bundling.  How much money does he save by cancelling his $60 cable package?",
        "gold_reasoning": "Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20 By bundling he saves 20*.2=$<<20*.2=4>>4 So in total it cost 20-4=$<<20-4=16>>16 So he pays 16+10=$<<16+10=26>>26 for streaming That means he saves 60-26=$<<60-26=34>>34 a month",

She spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on birthday presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags for the party guests. She split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents. How many dollars did each person pay?",
        "gold_reasoning": "Isabelle spent 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = $<<12+43+15+4+22=96>>96 on party supplies. The cost was evenly split 3 ways, so each person paid 96 \/ 3 = $<<96\/3=32>>32.",
