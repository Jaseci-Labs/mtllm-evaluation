Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate Weng's earnings. First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 minutes is equal to 0.83 hours (50/60). Now, we can multiply the amount of time Weng worked by her hourly wage to get her total earnings.

Question: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?

Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to determine how many pages Julie has left to read after today and then calculate half of that amount for tomorrow's reading goal. First, we need to figure out how many pages Julie read today, which is twice the number of pages she read yesterday (12 pages). So, 2 * 12 = 24 pages were read today. In total, she has read 12 + 24 = 36 pages so far. To find out how many pages are left in the book after today's reading, we subtract the total pages read from the total number of pages in the book: 120 - 36 = 84 pages left. Since Julie wants to read half of these remaining pages tomorrow, we divide the remaining pages by 2: 84 / 2 = 42.\nAnswer: 42""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama3.1:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-03T21:49:49.31668324Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 22818, 279, 5151, 1595, 7998, 7964, 8356, 279, 5151, 1595, 9399, 63438, 45464, 12763, 279, 2768, 3645, 382, 14924, 25, 3654, 7998, 534, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 3654, 98374, 279, 4320, 7966, 1226, 12515, 16533, 25, 3654, 9399, 92, 320, 66454, 449, 264, 3254, 528, 907, 696, 45464, 14924, 25, 42287, 374, 5403, 264, 220, 4364, 15463, 2363, 13, 61133, 11, 1364, 574, 3025, 311, 1373, 220, 717, 6959, 323, 3432, 11, 1364, 1373, 11157, 439, 1690, 6959, 439, 13985, 13, 1442, 1364, 6944, 311, 1373, 4376, 315, 279, 9861, 6959, 16986, 11, 1268, 1690, 6959, 1288, 1364, 1373, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 14924, 25, 42287, 374, 5403, 264, 220, 4364, 15463, 2363, 13, 61133, 11, 1364, 574, 3025, 311, 1373, 220, 717, 6959, 323, 3432, 11, 1364, 1373, 11157, 439, 1690, 6959, 439, 13985, 13, 1442, 1364, 6944, 311, 1373, 4376, 315, 279, 9861, 6959, 16986, 11, 1268, 1690, 6959, 1288, 1364, 1373, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 8417, 1268, 1690, 6959, 42287, 706, 2163, 311, 1373, 1306, 3432, 323, 1243, 11294, 4376, 315, 430, 3392, 369, 16986, 596, 5403, 5915, 13, 5629, 11, 584, 1205, 311, 7216, 704, 1268, 1690, 6959, 42287, 1373, 3432, 11, 902, 374, 11157, 279, 1396, 315, 6959, 1364, 1373, 13985, 320, 717, 6959, 570, 2100, 11, 220, 17, 353, 220, 717, 284, 220, 1187, 6959, 1051, 1373, 3432, 13, 763, 2860, 11, 1364, 706, 1373, 220, 717, 489, 220, 1187, 284, 220, 1927, 6959, 779, 3117, 13, 2057, 1505, 704, 1268, 1690, 6959, 527, 2163, 304, 279, 2363, 1306, 3432, 596, 5403, 11, 584, 33356, 279, 2860, 6959, 1373, 505, 279, 2860, 1396, 315, 6959, 304, 279, 2363, 25, 220, 4364, 482, 220, 1927, 284, 220, 5833, 6959, 2163, 13, 8876, 42287, 6944, 311, 1373, 4376, 315, 1521, 9861, 6959, 16986, 11, 584, 22497, 279, 9861, 6959, 555, 220, 17, 25, 220, 5833, 611, 220, 17, 284, 220, 2983, 627, 16533, 25, 220, 2983], ""total_duration"": 143549826635, ""load_duration"": 19945876643, ""prompt_eval_count"": 130, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1674164000, ""eval_count"": 227, ""eval_duration"": 121883319000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 130, ""completion_tokens"": 227, ""total_tokens"": 357}}]",

We know that ten flowers are yellow, and there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. That means there are 10 + (10 x 1.8) = 34 purple flowers. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers, so the number of green flowers is (10 + 34) / 4 = 17.

Finally, he adds gummy worms to double the weight again, so now it's 2 x 8 = 16 pounds.\n\nAnswer: 16""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama3:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-03T22:25:02.369843991Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 22818, 279, 5151, 1595, 7998, 7964, 8356, 279, 5151, 1595, 9399, 63438, 45464, 12763, 279, 2768, 3645, 382, 14924, 25, 3654, 7998, 534, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 3654, 98374, 279, 4320, 7966, 1226, 12515, 16533, 25, 3654, 9399, 92, 320, 66454, 449, 264, 3254, 528, 907, 696, 45464, 14924, 25, 14594, 3549, 264, 2512, 6462, 311, 3708, 311, 813, 10868, 11, 889, 574, 3201, 520, 50069, 2978, 13, 220, 14594, 9277, 264, 3830, 389, 264, 5569, 11, 323, 1243, 568, 44033, 1139, 279, 3830, 3403, 52441, 27994, 311, 4546, 279, 4785, 311, 220, 17, 16701, 13, 220, 5112, 11, 568, 3779, 3403, 14198, 552, 311, 5353, 279, 4785, 311, 24657, 13, 220, 9479, 11, 568, 3779, 2500, 220, 17, 16701, 315, 52441, 27994, 13, 220, 1628, 5616, 11, 568, 3779, 3403, 342, 8742, 63000, 311, 2033, 279, 4785, 3131, 1578, 13, 220, 3639, 574, 279, 1620, 4785, 315, 279, 3830, 315, 70855, 11, 304, 16701, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 98374, 279, 4320, 382, 791, 2926, 4785, 374, 220, 15, 16701, 13, 5112, 14594, 11621, 52441, 27994, 3156, 433, 25501, 220, 17, 16701, 13, 9479, 11, 568, 11621, 14198, 552, 323, 89661, 279, 4785, 11, 779, 1457, 433, 596, 220, 18, 865, 220, 17, 284, 220, 21, 16701, 13, 4740, 430, 11, 568, 11621, 2500, 220, 17, 16701, 315, 52441, 27994, 11, 3339, 433, 220, 21, 489, 220, 17, 284, 220, 23, 16701, 13, 17830, 11, 568, 11621, 342, 8742, 63000, 311, 2033, 279, 4785, 1578, 11, 779, 1457, 433, 596, 220, 17, 865, 220, 23, 284, 220, 845, 16701, 382, 16533, 25, 220, 845], ""total_duration"": 73432334243, ""load_duration"": 19355922457, ""prompt_eval_count"": 186, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1716555000, ""eval_count"": 106, ""eval_duration"": 52349420000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 186, ""completion_tokens"": 106, ""total_tokens"": 292}}]",

She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes. We know that she spent a total of $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $145 on her other clothes. We also know that she has $16 left from her budget, so the total amount she spent on all her clothes is $145 + $16 = $161. Since she lost the receipt for the shoes, we can't know for sure how much she paid for them, but we can infer that she paid less than $161 - $145 = $16 for the shoes.

Solving for x gives us x = 57 - 16 = 41.\n\nAnswer: 41""}, ""finish_reason"": ""stop""}], ""additional_kwargs"": {""model"": ""llama3.1:70b"", ""created_at"": ""2024-10-03T22:39:04.830556228Z"", ""done"": true, ""done_reason"": ""stop"", ""context"": [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 22818, 279, 5151, 1595, 7998, 7964, 8356, 279, 5151, 1595, 9399, 63438, 45464, 12763, 279, 2768, 3645, 382, 14924, 25, 3654, 7998, 534, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 3654, 98374, 279, 4320, 7966, 1226, 12515, 16533, 25, 3654, 9399, 92, 320, 66454, 449, 264, 3254, 528, 907, 696, 45464, 14924, 25, 60061, 374, 19486, 369, 264, 502, 2683, 323, 11021, 264, 502, 743, 315, 2626, 15447, 311, 10051, 311, 279, 7274, 13, 3005, 4024, 311, 264, 9476, 3637, 449, 264, 8199, 315, 400, 1049, 323, 7543, 400, 966, 389, 264, 3215, 5352, 15845, 11, 400, 2790, 389, 7937, 25567, 11, 400, 1987, 389, 264, 7937, 23724, 11, 400, 806, 389, 40086, 11, 323, 400, 972, 389, 264, 19671, 13, 3005, 1101, 15075, 264, 6857, 315, 15653, 11, 719, 5675, 279, 23383, 369, 1124, 13, 3005, 706, 400, 845, 2163, 505, 1077, 8199, 13, 2650, 1790, 1550, 60061, 2343, 369, 279, 15653, 5380, 26197, 287, 25, 6914, 596, 1781, 3094, 555, 3094, 304, 2015, 311, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 1131, 11294, 1268, 1790, 1364, 7543, 389, 279, 15653, 13, 5629, 11, 584, 1205, 311, 923, 709, 682, 279, 1023, 3673, 1364, 15075, 25, 400, 966, 489, 400, 2790, 489, 400, 1987, 489, 400, 806, 489, 400, 972, 284, 400, 10290, 13, 5112, 11, 584, 33356, 420, 2860, 505, 1077, 4113, 8199, 315, 400, 1049, 311, 1505, 704, 1268, 1790, 3300, 574, 2163, 369, 279, 15653, 323, 279, 9861, 8515, 25, 400, 1049, 482, 400, 10290, 284, 400, 3226, 13, 8876, 60061, 706, 400, 845, 2163, 1306, 12096, 4395, 11, 2737, 279, 15653, 11, 584, 649, 743, 709, 459, 24524, 1405, 865, 374, 279, 3430, 315, 279, 15653, 25, 865, 489, 220, 845, 284, 220, 3226, 13, 11730, 4504, 369, 865, 6835, 603, 865, 284, 220, 3226, 482, 220, 845, 284, 220, 3174, 382, 16533, 25, 220, 3174], ""total_duration"": 95878352589, ""load_duration"": 19631807433, ""prompt_eval_count"": 181, ""prompt_eval_duration"": 1774620000, ""eval_count"": 139, ""eval_duration"": 74422470000}, ""usage"": {""prompt_tokens"": 181, ""completion_tokens"": 139, ""total_tokens"": 320}}]",
