## DSpy 

## Errors Encountered
1. When I tried to provide the input to Signature as a list of strings, I got the following error:
```python
import dspy

llm = dspy.OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=llm)

class OddWordOut(dspy.Signature):
    """Pict the Odd Word Out from the given list of words."""

    options: list[str] = dspy.InputField(desc="Options to pick from")
    odd_word: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Odd Word")

pred = dspy.ChainOfThought(OddWordOut)(options=["Bentley", "Ferrari", "Lamborghini", "Casio", "Toyota"])
print((pred.odd_word, pred.rationale))
``` 
```python
assert type(x) == str, f"Need format_handler for {field.input_variable} of type {type(x)}"
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError: Need format_handler for options of type <class 'list'>
```

### Overall Output (With Examples)
```yaml
("Options: [Bentley, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Casio, Toyota]\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the odd word. We need to identify the common category that most of the words belong to. Bentley, Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Toyota are all car manufacturers. Casio, on the other hand, is a brand known for electronics, such as watches and calculators.", 'Casio')

## Observations
1. MTLLM provided the most accurate answer to the question.
2. LMQL was not able to follow the expected format. But was able to provide the correct reasoning. without the correct answer separately.
3. DSPy was able to provide the correct answer but reasoning provided introduced some unwanted words such as 'Options:', 'Reasoning:', 'Let's think step by step in order to produce the odd word.'
